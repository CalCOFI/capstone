```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
bottle_rda <- here("data/processed/bottle.RData")
fig <- plot_ly() %>% 
  add_lines(x = c("a","b","c"), y = c(1,3,2))%>% 
  layout(title="sample figure", xaxis = list(title = 'x'), yaxis = list(title = 'y'), plot_bgcolor = "#c7daec") 

str(fig$x) 
```


```{r echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
