###Set up 

####Load Libraries
```{r}
library(readr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
```

####Read in Files 
```{r}
cast_bottle <- read_csv("data/bottle_and_cast.csv")
descrip <- read_csv("data/Bottle Field Descriptions (1).csv")
```

```{r}
sal_tem_o2 <- cast_bottle %>% 
  select(T_degC, Salnty, O2ml_L, Depthm, Btl_Cnt, Cast_ID, Year) %>% 
  pivot_longer(1:3, names_to = "Variable", values_to = "Data")
```


###Creating Graphs 

####Graph of Salinity, Temperature, and Oxygen vs Depth 
```{r}
sal_tem_o2_vs_depth <- ggplot(data = sal_tem_o2, aes(x = Data, y = Depthm)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color = Variable)) + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkred", "steelblue", "darkgreen")) + 
  scale_y_reverse()
  
  
sal_tem_o2_vs_depth

# panel of graphs instead of all on same/ diff scales? 
#time and space? 
```
Temperature and O2 both decrease with depth. 


####Graph of Year vs Oxygen 
```{r}

#multiple sampling in a year, first make an ave, (use day, month, hour), use just one depth, or location 

year_o2_plot <- ggplot(data = cast_bottle, aes(x = Year, y = O2ml_L, group = )) + 
  geom_line() + 
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkred", "steelblue", "darkgreen"))
  

year_o2_plot
```
Oxygen not decreasing with time? 


####Graph of pH vs Depth 
```{r}

#all Na's for depth with this current data, not much to do with pH right now 
ph1_vs_depth <- ggplot(data = cast_bottle, aes(x = pH1, y = Depthm)) + 
  geom_line()
  
ph1_vs_depth
```
####Looking into map making in R 
```{r}
#map making in R 
#possible use of tmap? 

#need a geographic shape of California and off the coast 
#probably find this online 

#can use conus to attach US map boundaries to data? Need to attach states to the cast_bottle data 
#maybe better to work with long and lat instead 

#definitely want to keep looking at this 




plot(st_geometry())

```
